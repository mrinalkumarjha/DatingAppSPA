porblem : 

when we pass data to controller and load using {{user?.name}}. here we have to use safe navigation 
operator (?) . other wise it gives undefined error if controller loads without data. so we make it 
not required by ?
It is very tideous to put ? each place. so below are the solution of this.

Solution: 

Use route resolver to get data from route directly.

So basically resolver is that intermediate code, which can be executed when a link has been
 clicked and before a component is loaded.

 by this we dont need to use safe navigation (?)
